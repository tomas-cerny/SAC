    Jose A. Lozano received the PhD in computer science in 1998 and currently is full professor in the Department of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence at the University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU (Spain) where he leads since 2005 the Intelligent Systems Group. His research interests ranged over several areas of computer science, particularly metaheuristic optimization, probabilistic graphical models and machine learning and their application to problems in biomedicine, bioinformatics, ecology and risk analysis, to name a few. Prof. Lozano has published more than 100 ISI journal papers receiving his works more than 9100 citations in google scholar. He is currently associate editor of IEEE Trans. on Neural Networks and Learning Systems and IEEE Trans. Evolutionary Computation and member of the editorial board of Evolutionary Computation journal, memetic computing and several other journals on computational intelligence.

    <p>
    The literature around machine learning has recently seen many problems that depart from the standard supervised classification problem. In these problems the common structure of a supervised dataset where there is a label associated to each instance is broken: an instance can have several labels, a label is assigned to a   subset of instances, etc.  These problems present different degrees of uncertainty in learning but also in prediction. In this talk we will provide a taxonomy of non-standard machine learning problems illustrating each of them with case examples. We will also elaborate on how to learn classifiers in these scenarios, how to evaluate them and finally we will point out to some results on PAC learning on these problems.
