                The aim of this tutorial is to bring together researchers and practitioners working on
various aspects of recommender systems for fashion domain, including data-driven and
knowledge based approaches. Hence, this tutorial aims to cover both the theory and
practice of Recommender Systems, providing a systematic study and techniques for
making personalized recommendations, including their main concepts and approaches
with a detailed taxonomy, as well as illustrating them with practical examples. Thus, the
first part of the tutorial introduces concepts, methods and techniques associated with
artificial intelligence techniques focused on recommender systems and data
mining/machine learning. The second part covers aspects of constructing fashion
personalized applications of recommendation systems, giving participants the
opportunity to know the potential of such systems in fashion domain, including
demonstration of a clothing personalized recommender system.

                This tutorial is intended to provide a global overview of specialized machine learning
models in order to design and develop real-time recommendations engines.<br/>
During the tutorial, an advance big data platform (Hupi platform) will be introduced.
This platform include a rich set of components (i.e. spark 2.1 framework and the
scala 2.11 language, etc.) intended to ensure a complete data processing cycle
while respecting real time constraints.<br/>
During the tutorial, the following phases will be illustrated:<br/>
- The collection of any data set, of any size, from any sources, including data flows<br/>
- The storage of high volume of data on a cluster environment guaranteeing high
performance<br/>
- The distributed computation for real time analysis by machine learning algorithms
to generate well-adapted recommendations<br/>
- The visualization functionalities allowing to check the results of the
recommendations and to track their performance<br/>
- The automation module to push the results to external systems in real time.<br/>
Based on these components several recommendation models will be designed and
implemented, including several styles such as ALS, item-item, user-item, etc. An
event-oriented approach will be followed based on specific features in order to
implement real-time reactive services.<br/>
Moreover, secured access to Restful APIs will be studied in order to provide real-
time recommendation systems for interactive environments, such as e-commerce
systems.

                We rely on web applications to perform many useful activities. Despite the awareness over the
past decade on secure programming practices and tools on vulnerability discovery in the
implementation, we still observe the presence of known vulnerabilities. Both the client sides and
server sides are responsible to let attackers exploiting vulnerabilities with malicious inputs. Web
services are used as integral part of web applications and they remain vulnerable when not
implemented securely. Given that an understanding of the common vulnerabilities for applications
and services are essential for practitioners to tame the unsecured web.<br/>
In this tutorial, we will provide an overview of common vulnerabilities for web applications and
web services, followed by common techniques useful to combat against security threats. In
particular, we will discuss implementation level vulnerabilities for applications (e.g., code
injection, object injection, clickjacking) along with a popular mitigation approach known as
security testing. We also focus on web service security vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques
followed by best practices.

                This tutorial demonstrates a Raspberry PI device connected to the Watson IoT IBM Cloud
platform. This system could, for example, be used as a domotic system: the Raspberry PI is a
MQTT client receiving message to take pictures and these are then stored on the IBM Cloud
platform and sent to the Watson visual recognition service hosted by the IBM Cloud platform.
The half day is decomposed in 2 steps. In a first step, a presentation and demonstration of the
IBM Cloud of an existing system connecting a Raspberry PI and, in a second step, a hands-on
session where the participants creates on their own IBM Cloud platform account an extension of
the existing system using a NodeRed editor calling the Watson visual recognition service.
