                Networks have become ubiquitous in several social, economical and scientific fields, ranging from the Internet to social sciences,
                biology, epidemiology, geography, communication systems, finance and many others. For this reason, in recent years several data mining
                approaches, specifically designed for tackling predictive and descriptive tasks for network structured data, have been proposed.
                The main challenges they have to face with are: i) the inherent dependency of the connected node which introduces some form of
                autocorrelation ii) the possible dynamic nature of network data which demands for data stream mining algorithms iii) the possible
                heterogeneity of nodes and edges. In this tutorial we will discuss the different data mining tasks typically considered when mining
                network data, with particular emphasis on the three main challenges described before. It will conclude with a review of some practical
                applications of the presented methods in the areas of functional genomics, sensor networks, and social networks.
