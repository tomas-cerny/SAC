            <p>
                The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) does not issue formal invitation letters for visas to attend ACM sponsored conferences.
                However, ACM can issue a visa support letter. For visa support letters, please send all requests to the Office of SIG Services
                at <a href="mailto:supportletters@acm.org">supportletters@acm.org</a>.
                Please be sure to include all of the following information in your original email:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Your name as it appears on your passport</li>
                <li>Your current postal mailing address</li>
                <li>The name of the conference (ACM SAC <span class="sac_year"></span>)</li>
                <li>Your Registration Confirmation number</li>
                <li>If you have any papers accepted for the conference, please provide the title and indicate whether you are the ‘sole author’ or a ‘co- author’</li>
            </ol>
            <p></p>
            <p> All this information is necessary, and omitting any of it will delay the issuing of the support letter.
                Visa support letters are answered in the order they are received.
                You will receive a PDF letter by email within the 4-5 business days.
                Please note that ACM does not fax visa support letters.
                The PDF serves as a signed electronic version of the original letter which will be mailed to your current mailing address.
                If you do not receive the letter by post mail on time for your visa appointment, please print out your PDF letter and take it with you.
            </p>
            <p> Please plan accordingly.
