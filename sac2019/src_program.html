            <p class="list-item-text">The Student Research Competition (SRC) program, sponsored by Microsoft Research,
                was added to the ACM SIGAPP Symposium on Applied Computing (SAC) in 2013.
                SAC <span class="sac_year"></span> SRC program provides <b>graduate students</b> the opportunity to meet
                and exchange ideas with researchers and practitioners in their areas of interest.
                Active graduate students seeking feedback from the scientific community on their research ideas are invited
                to submit abstracts of their original unpublished and in-progress research work in areas of experimental computing
                and application development related to SAC <span class="sac_year"></span> Tracks.</p>
            <p class="list-item-text">This program is open for graduate students currently enrolled in University or College and have active ACM and SIGAPP student membership. Abstracts must be authored by students only. Faculty advisor(s) cannot be listed as authors on the submission or on the final poster presentation. No group projects are allowed.
            </p>
            <p class="list-item-text">Graduate students are invited to submit research abstracts, of maximum 2 pages in ACM camera-ready format, to the START submission system. Abstracts must address original and unpublished research work related to a SAC track, with emphasis on the innovation behind the research idea. The submission should address the research problem being investigated, the proposed approach and research methodology, and sample preliminary results of the work. In addition, the abstract should reflect on the originality of the work, innovation of the approach, and applicability of the results to real-world problems
            </p>
            <p class="list-item-text">Submitting the same abstract to multiple SAC tracks is not allowed. The work must not be submitted to any another SRC program, journal or conference while it is under consideration for SAC <span class="sac_year"></span> SRC Program.
            </p>
            <p class="list-item-text">Student research abstracts must be submitted to their respective SAC tracks through the START submission system. The abstracts are reviewed by reviewers who review paper submissions to that track. The Track Chairs (TCs) manage the review process. Upon the review results, The SRC Chair and Program Committee select the best 18 abstracts and invite their authors to participate in SAC <span class="sac_year"></span>.
            </p>
            <p class="list-item-text">Each invited author receives $500 from ACM's SRC Program toward travel expenses
                such as Conference registration; Transportation expenses (air, rail, bus, taxi, car service, car rental, parking);
                Meals; Hotel rooms; Tips; Supplies for poster development; and Poster shipment, etc.
                In addition, invited authors are eligible to apply for the SIGAPP's Student Travel Award Program (STAP)
                for additional funding to cover travel expenses.
