    <p>
    The literature around machine learning has recently seen many problems that depart from the standard supervised classification problem. In these problems the common structure of a supervised dataset where there is a label associated to each instance is broken: an instance can have several labels, a label is assigned to a   subset of instances, etc.  These problems present different degrees of uncertainty in learning but also in prediction. In this talk we will provide a taxonomy of non-standard machine learning problems illustrating each of them with case examples. We will also elaborate on how to learn classifiers in these scenarios, how to evaluate them and finally we will point out to some results on PAC learning on these problems.

            <h4 class="list-item-heading">Abstract</h4>
            <p>
                Smart data systems and applications support the processing and integration of data into a unified view from disparate big data sources, sensors and devices in the Internet of Things, social platforms, and databases, whether on-premises or cloud, and software-as-a- service applications to enable more effective decision making. The decisive criterion here is not necessarily the amount of data available, but smart content techniques that promote not only the collection and accumulation of related data, but also its context, and understanding. This requires discovering associations between the data, prioritizing results, finding useful insights, discovering patterns and trends within the data to reveal a wider picture that is more relevant to the problem in hand and react to them. The mechanisms that convert stale data to smart data focus on knowledge-based meta-data representation techniques that structure and associate the data sets and content, annotate them, link them with associated processes and software services, and deliver or syndicate information to recipients. 
            </p><p>
                Smart Industrial-Purpose Applications are a new generation of software applications that combine the benefits of smart data and advanced analytics to help organizations manage their resources (including humans), data, sensors, processes and systems more efficiently. They promise to bring greater speed and efficiency to industries as diverse as smart agriculture, smart cities, smart manufacturing, and smart healthcare delivery where they can provide meaningful insights to decision makers and help them solve complex problems. 
            </p><p>    
                This talk will focus on the role, characteristics, potential of smart data and applications for diverse domains, and their enabling technologies. To illustrate the potential of smart data and applications, the talk will draw on examples that highlight the interplay of medical and technical aspects of smart healthcare applications.  Smart healthcare involves deploying computing, information, service, sensor and visualization technologies to aid in preventing disease, improving the quality of care and lowering overall cost. The talk will also examine the design and deployment requirements, particularly for point -of-care medical applications, which emerge from the interplay of the actual clinical situation and the novelty of the smart healthcare application.
