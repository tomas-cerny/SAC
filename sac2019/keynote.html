    <p>
            Over the past decade, deep learning techniques have been increasingly considered for the
            processing and analysis of hyperspectral data. A variety of tasks have been addressed, ranging
            from denoising, dimension reduction and feature extraction, to spectral unmixing, classification
            or data fusion. In 2008, the data fusion contest organized by the IEEE Geoscience and Remote
            Sensing Society served as an early warning milestone: the contest involved the classification of
            hyperspectral data. Among over 2000 entries to the contest, 9 out of the 10 best performing
            teams were using SVM and some sort of spectral spatial feature extraction or regularization. But
            the very best results were actually already achieved by a neural approach. In the following years
            and even more recently, deep learning techniques systematically dominate all the rankings. In
            this overview, special attention will be given to autoencoders and convolutional neural networks
            as well as their recent evolutions. In addition, the current challenges and future directions in the
            research of hyperspectral data processing will be provided.

            Yiorgos L. Chrysanthou is a Professor at the Computer Science Department of the University of Cyprus where he is heading the Graphics and Hypermedia lab. He is also the Research Director of the newly established Centre of Excellence on Interactive Media, Smart Systems and emerging Technologies (RISE). Yiorgos was educated in the UK (Queen Mary College, University of London) and worked for several years as a research fellow and a lecturer at University College London. He has published over 80 papers in journals and international conferences and served as the local or overall coordinator of over 27 research projects, related to 3D graphics, virtual reality and applications. His research interests lie in the general area of 3D Computer Graphics, recently focusing more on computer animation, algorithms for real-time AR and VR rendering and reconstruction of urban environments.

                Virtual environments are increasingly present in our lives, with a large number of potential applications. An indispensable component of many of these applications are virtual humans. From training for evacuation through to background scenes for a historical drama, virtual characters provide important context and constraints to the user; they can significantly improve the plausibility of the environment leading to a more realistic response, and ultimately, better understanding of the situation or better entertainment. Increasing processing power due to multicore architectures, improved clock speeds and highly programmable Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), enable designers and programmers to add multitudes of virtual characters in real-time applications. As the real-time rendering of the characters is becoming more and more realistic, there is a considerable gap between the rendering appearance and their simulated behavior. In this presentation we will look at some recent work on data-driven character simulation and animation covering both the simulation of virtual crowds and ambient life as well as the stylistic animation of individual characters.
