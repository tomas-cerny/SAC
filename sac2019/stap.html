    The <b>SIGAPP Student Travel Award Program (STAP)</b> was established to provide financial support for SIGAPP student members 
    to attend SIGAPP primary conference (SAC) to present their accepted work. Student primary authors and co-authors are eligible to 
    apply for these awards. The eligibility rules may vary year to year depending on funds availability. Applications are evaluated 
    on a competitive basis.
    <br/>
    Expenses eligible for coverage include conference registration fees, travel expenses to and from the conference, and accommodation 
    expenses while attending SAC. Note that meal expenses will not be covered by these grants, neither will cost related to getting a 
    visa to travel to the conference location. The award amounts vary year to year depending on type of travel (intercontinental or 
    intra-continental) and the applicants pool and their needs. SIGAPP expects institutions to share costs in funding students travel 
    to SAC.
    <br/>
    Reimbursement is handled by ACM after the end of the conference. Recipients will received instructions from ACM on how to claim 
    these awards.  Recipients need to keep original receipts for all eligible expenses as they are required for reimbursement.
