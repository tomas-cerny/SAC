                We discovered a mismatch between verification and validation of even very simple business processes based on service composition and using semantic service specification. In more in-depth studies, we found that it is due to different business context of applying these services. Hence, we introduced semantic task specification for specifying tasks in their respective business context, where a specific semantic task specification may become a supertype of the corresponding semantic service specification, and this can be recursively applied to higher-level semantic task specifications in business processes. Such semantic task specifications can be utilized for formal verification of traditionally represented business process models (e.g., through control flows defined in BPMN), where they semantically annotate the (BPMN) tasks. This verification through model checking determines whether time logic formulas specifying certain properties are violated (or not) in a behavioral business process model. The semantic task specifications facilitate the systematic derivation of such a behavioral model. It integrates object life cycle models with behavioral models derived from task-centric (BPMN) models, where the integration is done by use of semantic task specifications. Formalizing business rules through properties referring to object life cycles rather than directly to task-centric models has the advantage of decoupling and potential reuse for several business models. In effect, this verification can show that a business rule is fulfilled and, indirectly, that the corresponding semantic task specifications correctly define their business context. Such a formal verification of a business process based on, e.g., Web-services, can actually verify business software implementing such a business process on this process level. It is facilitated both by semantic service specifications and the newly introduced semantic task specifications.

                Software architecture has become a major discipline on applied computing, playing a key role in the specification of software-intensive systems, in particular in dynamic contexts where not only structure but also behavior needs to be addressed. In this tutorial, we present the SysADL language and the SysADL Studio tool providing both theoretical concepts and practical examples in a systematic approach to architectural design software-intensive systems on the Internet-of-Things. SysADL is a specialization of the ISO & OMG SysML Standard to software architecture description. It brings together the expressive power of architectural concepts following the ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 framework with a standard language used by the industry. SysADL has a rigorous operational semantics, which allows the analysis and execution of the software architecture. It is organized according to three integrated viewpoints: (i) structural; (ii) behavioral; and (iii) executable. The structural viewpoint describes the main building blocks of the software architecture from a conceptual point of view, while the behavioral viewpoint is concerned with the dynamic behavior of the architecture. The behavioral viewpoint has a precise operational semantics that describes the behavior using semantically defined actions, it allows the execution of the behavior by simulation, as well as supports verification. In this tutorial, we apply SysADL Studio to illustrate the concepts and to allow attendees to gain practical experience in modeling software architecture on the Internet-of-Things and executing modeled architectures for validation. In this tutorial, the audience will learn: (i) the concepts that provide the foundation for software architectural specification and model execution using SysADL; (ii) how to design a complete software architecture using SysADL Studio and a step-to-step running example. This tutorial targets software professionals and students and it is supported by a book (Oquendo, Flavio; Leite, Jair; Batista, Thais: Software Architecture in Action: Designing and Executing Architectural Models with SysADL Grounded on the OMG SysML Standard, Springer, 2016, https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319443379) and accompanying tool (available at www.sysadl.org).

                Connected devices and services, also referred to as the Internet of Things (IoT), are becoming more and more popular. These devices are now used in many security-critical domains. Moreover, even in non-critical domains, privacy issues may arise with devices collecting and transmitting a lot of personal information. It is therefore important to provide security guarantees for the software executed by these devices. This kind of guarantees can be brought using formal verification. In this tutorial, we describe several formal verification techniques and present them by applying Frama-C, a platform for the analysis of C programs, to verify IoT software. We illustrate it on several examples taken from Contiki, a lightweight operating system for Internet of Things. Participants will learn how to use the different Frama-C analyzers and how to combine them. Several examples and use cases presented during the tutorial will give them a clear practical vision of possible usages of the underlying static and dynamic analyses in their everyday work.

                Allan Blanchard obtained his PhD in Computer Science from the University of Orléans in 2016. He prepared his PhD at the Software Reliability Laboratory of the CEA LIST. He is interested in the analysis of concurrent code using formal methods and more precisely deductive verification. His current work, in the EU H2020 VESSEDIA project, is to apply formal verification to the Contiki microkernel and its libraries, mostly to show the absence of runtime errors. He mostly uses Frama-C with the EVA and WP plugins. He is the author of an online tutorial on deductive verification with Frama-C and its WP plugin. Web site: https://allan-blanchard.fr

                When the requirements and the interaction design of a system are separated, they will most likely not fit together, and the resulting system will be less than optimal. Even if all the real needs are covered in the requirements and also implemented, errors may be induced by human-computer interaction through a bad interaction design and its resulting user interface. Such a system may even not be used at all. Alternatively, a great user interface of a system with features that are not required will not be very useful as well. This tutorial explains joint modeling of (communicative) interaction design and requirements, through discourse models and ontologies. Our discourse models are derived from results of human communication theories, cognitive science and sociology (even without employing speech or natural language). While these models were originally devised for capturing interaction design, it turned out that they can be also viewed as specifying classes of scenarios, i.e., use cases. In this sense, they can also be utilized for specifying requirements. Ontologies are used to define domain models and the domains of discourse for the interactions with software systems. User interfaces for these software systems can be generated semi-automatically from our discourse models, domain-of-discourse models and specifications of the requirements. This is especially useful when user interfaces for different devices are needed. Specific usability requirements can be dealt with in our approach through advanced customization approaches. Hence, interaction design facilitates requirements engineering to make applications both more useful and usable.
